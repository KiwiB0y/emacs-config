# emacs-config
this is my full emacs configuration

## What's in it?

what I have done with it is the following 

  - Removed the ringing sound of the notification bell
  - Added a dracula theme in ~/.emacs.d/themes
  - Added a parethesis pairing feature
  - Added a check on the fly feature 
  - Added an autocomplete feature and set the trigger key to *tab*
